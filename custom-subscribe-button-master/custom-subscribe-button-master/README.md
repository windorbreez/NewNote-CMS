### You'll need...

*   A [Campaign Monitor account](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/)
*   A subscriber list
*   A generated [subscribe form code](http://help.campaignmonitor.com/topic.aspx?t=13)


### Assets
There are also a few assets you need to include on your page to get this working

*   [jQuery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js)
*   Twitter Bootstrap's [modal plugin](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals)
*   [Jimmy's Ajax subscribe function](https://gist.github.com/jdennes/1155479)


### Make it your own
There is very little CSS required to make the modal window open correctly, you'll find what you need in `css/basic.css`. The rest of the modal and button styling is up to you... keep it basic, or make it look something like `fancy.html`
